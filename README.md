# STS
Smarter Trading Systems. STS is a simple, yet powerful tool designed to help traders track and analyze their performance. 
Build in Python with Flask. There are a lot of futures and spot tracking and journal apps/sites out there but none of them fit into a specific trading style so decided to build my own because excel started to get annoying. 

On main page you filter the visible trades in the last 30, this week, last month and all trades. You can edit each trade and make 'child' trades where for example you take partial profits or open a bigger position. These are taken into consideration of the calculation of the 'parent' trade.
There is the possibility to enter hypothetical trades in a seperate account.

When you click on a trade you go to the trade detail where you can enter the reason why you opened a trade and add a picture. The same can be done for feedback once the trade is closed.

There are a few analytics now available which can also be seen for this month, last month, this year and all trades.

For the future improving the UI, expand the analytics, incorporate ai into reason and feedback and work on the lab part.
